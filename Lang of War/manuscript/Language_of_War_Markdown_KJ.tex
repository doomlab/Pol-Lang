\abstract{
Legislative bodies have very important roles and understanding the
psychology of their decision-making processes is a useful area of study.
We add to this area by examining Congressional decision making when it
comes to war measures and exploring where lawmakers' attention is
focused when debating these issues. The present study hypothesized that
legislators who support war measures focus more on other people and on
the present circumstances. Speeches were obtained pertaining to the
decisions for the U.S. to take military action in Kosovo, Iraq, and
Libya. While we found mixed results depending on the circumstances of a
specific conflict, we demonstrate how automated language analysis can be
combined with voting records to better understand behavioral action,
such as legislative decision.

\maketitle

In the last few years, numerous civil disputes worldwide, which might
threaten American interests and human rights, have spurred considerable
debate over American military intervention. Over the past two decades,
the U.S. and its allies have faced a variety of international threats
and difficulties including possible nuclear weapons in
hostile/unfriendly nations such as Iran and human rights abuses and
genocide in Sudan and other nations. Despite declines in legislative
control of foreign policy, the U.S. Congress still plays an important
role in deciding how the military is used by retaining the rights to
formally declare war, limit the use of military force, and control
military appropriations (Phelps \& Boylan, 2002). Previous research
examined the predictors of presidential use of military force (Clark \&
Nordstrom, 2005; Keller \& Foster, 2012) and predictors of public
support for war (Cohrs \& Moschner, 2002; Friese, Fishman, Beatson,
Sauerwein, \& Rip, 2009; McCleary, Nalls, \& Williams, 2009). However,
the predictors of legislative support of military action have been
understudied, thus presenting an interesting opportunity for exploration
as well as replication of past studies in new contexts (Kriner \& Shen,
2014).

In this study, we sought to replicate two studies of the role of
linguistic style in predicting war attitudes and behaviors, Abe (2012)
and Matsumoto, Frank, and Hwang (2015). Rather than use what people were
thinking about, these studies focused on how people were thinking about
the issues surrounding war freeing the investigation from issues of
context as well as allowing a more psychological understanding of the
process of conflict decisions and rationalizations. Abe (2012) analyzed
the cognitive styles and attentional focus of online discussions of the
Iraq War finding supporters of the war tended to have a simplistic
thinking style and external focus while opponents tended to have a more
complex thinking style and internal focus. Matsumoto et al. (2015)
analyzed the same linguistic constructs for texts of world leaders
preceding acts of aggression, such as wars or bombings, finding similar
results with higher external focus and lower cognitive complexity
preceding aggressive acts. In our replication of these studies, we
analyze the same linguistic constructs in the context of a legislative
body (i.e.~U.S. Congress) voting on war measures.

\#\#Politics and Conflict

When it comes to studying war actions and attitudes, there has been
considerable research into the roles of the executive and public opinion
as, in many ways, these are the most salient actors in a conflict
situation. The executive is arguably the most visible political actor in
American politics and is the main agent for shaping and building foreign
policy including military action. As such, predicting when executives
will use force and understanding how they justify it has been the object
of many studies. A few examples include Clark and Nordstrom (2005), who
examined the political factors which predicted an executive choosing to
engage in conflict, Keller and Foster (2012), who explored leadership
traits as a predictor of an executive's use of diversionary force, and
Leudar, Marsland, and Nekvapil (2004), who used 9/11 as a case study to
understand how executives justify the use of force. Similarly, public
opinion is also a highly visible factor during wartime which can hinder
or halt political action come election day. Among the numerous studies
in this area, some of the factors which have been found to be related to
support for war include militarism, diffuse political support,
authoritarianism, concern for national security, and attribution of
responsibility (Cohrs \& Moschner, 2002; Friese et al., 2009; McCleary
et al., 2009).

The role of the legislature is generally less salient and visible.
However, as previously discussed, Congress does have an important role
in war and the military, and there have been some studies examining
their role. Here we focus on one study, in particular, which is most
relevant to the current investigation. Kriner and Shen (2014) studied
speeches pertaining to the course of the Iraq War in the House of
Representatives and found that antiwar rhetoric by Democrats increased
as the number of casualties in the war increased, and specifically, the
number of casualties from representatives' districts. Speeches were
coded as antiwar if they included arguments that the initial invasion
was a mistake or that troops should be withdrawn; for instance, if the
congressperson discussed causalities as unacceptably high or argued that
the invasion was unjustified as Saddam Hussein posed no immediate
threat. Furthermore, number of casualties also predicted antiwar voting
by Democrats, and antiwar rhetoric by representatives was positively
correlated with antiwar attitudes held by their constituents. In
examining war discourse, Kriner and Shen (2014) only surveyed whether
the overall content of each speech was prowar or antiwar not the
specifics of the language used. In the current investigation, we seek to
expand on Kriner and Shen (2014)'s work by focusing on war rhetoric
leading up to actual votes on war measures, as well as by using
automated language analysis to explore psychological processes in this
rhetoric.

\hypertarget{psychological-language-analysis}{%
\subsection{Psychological Language
Analysis}\label{psychological-language-analysis}}

Language, including political rhetoric, is the fusion of content and
style words. Within any given sample of language, content words answer
the question of what is being said, while style words answer the
question of how it is being said. Content words include nouns, verbs,
and adjectives, and style words include pronouns, prepositions,
articles, conjunctions, negations, and quantifiers (Pennebaker, 2011).
The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program (LIWC2007; Pennebaker,
Booth, \& Frances, 2007) is text analysis software developed to
summarize these types of words by breaking them down into 82 language
categories. Besides style words, the LIWC measures constructs including:
a) cognitive processes, such as \emph{know}, \emph{because}, and
\emph{none} reflecting causation, exclusivity, and certainty, b)
emotionality, which include words such as \emph{happy}, \emph{sad}, and
\emph{angry}, c) relativity, such as \emph{go}, \emph{down}, and
\emph{until} reflecting motion, space, and time, and d) personal
concerns like money, death, and religion among others. In many fields
including social psychology, the LIWC analysis has become a common way
to better understand psychological processes through the words people
use. Tausczik and Pennebaker (2010) reviewed over 100 articles that used
language as a basis for studying other constructs; specifically, these
studies investigated how categories in the LIWC are related to
psychological phenomena, such as attention, dominance, and deception. In
the current investigation, we focus on attention as a potential
mechanism for understanding how legislator's might work through
decisions about war.

Just as a person's gaze can illuminate where their attention is so can
the words they use. Specifically, pronouns and verb tense can
demonstrate attentional focus by indicating who or what someone is
attending to in a situation and how they are processing the situation.
Therefore, greater use of first person pronouns indicated a self focus,
third person pronouns indicated a focus on others, and verb tense
indicated whether the focus was on past, present, or future events
(Tausczik \& Pennebaker, 2010). Attentional focus in the form of
pronouns has been linked to depression (Rude, Gortner, \& Pennebaker,
2004), bullying (Kowalski, 2000), and marital satisfaction (Simmons,
Gordon, \& Chambless, 2005). In the studies we seek to replicate, Abe
(2012) found supporters of the war tended to have an external focus,
using more third person pronouns, while opponents of the war tended to
have an internal focus, using more first person pronouns. Matsumoto et
al. (2015) also found greater use of plural third person pronouns (i.e.,
\emph{we}, \emph{us}) predicted aggressive acts by groups by examining
historical texts.

Another construct which can be automatically measured from language is
cognitive complexity. (in progress)

\hypertarget{hypotheses}{%
\subsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}}

H1: Supporters of war measures will focus on other people and will
therefore use more third person pronouns (Abe, 2012; Matsumoto et al.,
2015).

H2: Supporters of wars measures will focus on past events and will
therefore use more past tense verbs (Abe, 2012).

\hypertarget{language-samples}{%
\subsection{Language Samples}\label{language-samples}}

Linguistic frequency analysis was conducted on political speeches
gleaned from Congress. The source of language samples was the
Congressional Record, a searchable database containing a record of each
session of Congress since 1995 available at
\url{https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record}, which is maintained
by the U.S. Government Publishing Office. For this study, we searched
for pertinent speeches from January 27, 1998 to September 19, 2013.
Records were included if they pertained to U.S. relations with the
following countries: Iraq, Libya, and Kosovo (see below for explanation
of country selection). Samples were split by session date and person
speaking, and therefore, each person could be represented multiple times
in the dataset. Each file in the Congressional Record includes all
speeches from the day selected, therefore, we separated each person's
speeches by day into different files for processing. For example, a
Senator may respond back and forth with an invited guest speaker, and
all the Senators spoken words would be combined into one file for that
day. Only Senators and Representatives were included in this analysis.
These speeches were then coded for party affiliation of the
Congressperson. All processed data, as well as an \emph{R} markdown
document with data analysis scripts inline with this manuscript (Aust \&
Barth, 2017) can be found at \url{https://osf.io/r8qp2/}.

\hypertarget{variables}{%
\subsection{Variables}\label{variables}}

\hypertarget{language}{%
\subsubsection{Language}\label{language}}

Each language sample was analyzed using the Language Inquiry and Word
Count (Pennebaker et al., 2007). We examined pronouns for Hypothesis 1
and verbs for Hypothesis 2. The pronouns category included first person
singular and plural pronouns (\emph{I, me, we}), second person pronouns
(\emph{you, your}), and third person singular and plural pronouns
(\emph{he, she, they}). The verbs category included past, present, and
future tense verbs (\emph{went, does, will}). The LIWC provides
percentages of each individual text that fall into these categories.

\hypertarget{military-action}{%
\subsubsection{Military Action}\label{military-action}}

For the purpose of this study, military action was defined as military
personnel being sent into another nation to coerce the actions of that
nation. In the past 15 years, the U.S. has taken military action against
Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, and Libya, although Congress did not
explicitly approve action in Afghanistan or Libya. Operational
definitions for support for war were voting records (yay, nay) on bills
authorizing military action for Iraq, Kosovo, and Libya (only voted on
in the House). These bills were House Joint Resolution 114, 107th
Congress (2002); Senate Concurrent Resolution 21, 106th Congress (1999);
and House Joint Resolution 68, 112th Congress (2011). Oppose or support
information was combined with the LIWC percentages described above.

\hypertarget{data-analytic-technique}{%
\subsection{Data Analytic Technique}\label{data-analytic-technique}}

The data collected include multiple language samples by the same senator
and are structured by both party affiliation and region of interest.
This structure was best analyzed with multilevel modeling, which allowed
us to control for the correlated error terms of senator and party. We
used the \emph{nlme} package to calculate the means and standard
deviation for each variable by voting recording (Pinheiro, Bates,
Debroy, Sarkar, \& Team, 2017). The intercept was used to predict the
dependent variable (LIWC category percent), which creates a mean score
for the dependent variable. Party affiliation and Congressperson name
were controlled as random intercept factors (Gelman, 2006). The standard
error of the estimate was translated into standard deviation by
multiplying by the square root of n for the sample. This analysis was
bootstrapped using the \emph{boot} library 1000 times, and the normal
confidence interval for the mean was calculated using this function
(Canty \& Ripley, 2017). These values were separated by voting record,
Senate/House, and country of interest. The means and confidence
intervals are presented in forest plots to show the relative percentages
for each combination. The bootstrapped standard deviation values were
used to calculate \(d_s\) values using the MOTE library with the pooled
standard deviation as the denominator (Buchanan, Valentine, \& Scofield,
2017; Lakens, 2013).

\section{Study 1A - Kosovo in the
House}\label{study-1a---kosovo-in-the-house}}

In early 1998, violence erupted in the Serbian region of Kosovo between
ethnic Albanians and the Serbian government. A peace agreement later in
the year lasted until the beginning of 1999 when several Albanian
civilians were killed, prompting a resurrection of hostilities. When the
Serbian government, namely President Slobodan Milosevic, failed to
concede to allowing a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo during February
1999 negotiations, NATO authorized air strikes against Serbian targets.
This decision subsequently prompted debate within the U.S. Congress as
to the involvement of the U.S. military in NATO's operations in Serbia
and Kosovo (Woehrel \& Kim, 2006).

In this study, we examine this debate in the U.S. House of
Representatives to determine if members of Congress who supported U.S.
military involvement focused on people or events differently than those
who opposed it.

\hypertarget{method-1}{%
\section{Method}\label{method-1}}

Speeches made in the House of Representatives pertaining to the use of
military force in Kosovo/Serbia were gathered from the Congressional
Record available from the U.S. Government Publishing Office. In total,
210 speeches were collected. Speeches were limited to those made in the
year preceding the vote on Senate Concurrent Resolution 21 made on April
28, 1999 to allow the President to conduct air and missile strikes
against Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). This resolution failed in
the House with 213-213 with 86\% of Democrats supporting the resolution
and 84\% of Republicans opposing. These speeches were made by 156 unique
speakers where where Republicans gave 108 speeches, Democrats gave 98
speeches, one Independent, one Non-Partisan, and two
non-Representatives. Five speeches were excluded for no voting record.
The average word count was 700.51 (\emph{SD} = 814.04).

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

A forest plot of the results can be found in Figure \ref{fig:Kpic}, and
all descriptive statistics can be found in Table \ref{tab:Ktable}. A
small effect emerged for first-person singular pronouns and future tense
verbs. Members of Congress who supported U.S. military action tended to
use slightly more self-references and references to future actions.

\hypertarget{study-1b---kosovo-in-the-senate}{%
\section{Study 1B - Kosovo in the
Senate}\label{study-1b---kosovo-in-the-senate}}

In the second part of this study, we examined the Kosovo debate in the
U.S. Senate to determine if the differences found in the first part of
the study replicate in a slightly different context.

\hypertarget{method-2}{%
\section{Method}\label{method-2}}

Speeches were gathered in the same manner as in the first part of the
study. All speeches made in the Senate in the year before the March 23,
1999 vote on Senate Concurrent Resolution 21. This resolution passed the
Senate with 58 supporting and 41 opposing. All but 3 Democrats supported
the resolution while 70\% of Republicans opposed it. A total of 49
speeches were collected. These speeches were made by 25 unique senators
with 12 speeches by Democrats and 37 by Republicans. The average word
count for these speeches was 1413.14 (\emph{SD} = 1076.37).

\hypertarget{results-1}{%
\section{Results}\label{results-1}}

Analyses were conducted in the same manner as the first part of the
study with bootstrapped means and CIs calculated for the seven
categories marking attention. Results can be seen as a forest plot in
Figure \ref{fig:Kpic} and Table \ref{tab:Ktable}. Sizable differences
were found in the use of first-person plural pronouns, third-person
plural pronouns, and present-tense verbs. Senators who opposed U.S.
military involvement in Kosovo tended make more group-references both to
their own group and the out-group. Senators opposed to the legislation
also tended to make more reference to current actions.

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

The results of this first study are inconsistent and contrary to our
hypotheses. The results were inconsistent in that effects found for the
House and Senate are non-overlapping. For the House, supporters of war
used more first person singular (\emph{I}) and future tense verbs, while
opposition in the Senate used more first person singular (\emph{we}) and
present tense verbs. It is difficult to know exactly why this is the
case; however there are several possible explanations. First, voting in
Congress is exceedingly complex and is influenced by much more than
floor debates in a given chamber. In this case, the Senate vote on the
resolution occurred before the main debate in the House, which may have
influenced what the debate focused on. Second, the Senate and the House
are composed differently. Members of the House serve two year terms
while Senators serve six year terms. Furthermore, Senators typically
have more political experience than members of the House. These, as well
as other factors, may help explain the differential effects for the two
chambers of Congress.

The results of the second part of this study were also contrary to our
hypotheses. In the Senate, opposers focused more on the in-group
(\emph{we}) and more on the present, and in the House, supporters
focused more on themselves (\emph{I}) and more on the future. This
finding suggests that those who opposed military action focused more on
others and the present. Based on the findings of Abe (2012) and
Matsumoto et al. (2015), we expected those who supported military action
to show this focus. However, the results could be explained by the
situation posed by the particular resolution. In this conflict, rather
than responding to an act of aggression or a perceived threat, the U.S.
was deciding the extent to which the U.S. would be involved in ongoing
NATO, a treaty organization of which the U.S. is a member, operations in
Kosovo and Serbia. It is possible that some viewed the out-group as NATO
rather than Serbians. In this case, with no clear, immediate threat to
the U.S., for those making in-group-out-group distinctions, protecting
the in-group may have meant opposing the war rather than supporting it.
In order to determine if the situation surrounding the Kosovo conflict
may have impacted the first study, we next turned to examine the Iraq
War which was had more support and also represented a possible clear
threat to the U.S.

\hypertarget{study-2a---iraq-in-the-house}{%
\section{Study 2A - Iraq in the
House}\label{study-2a---iraq-in-the-house}}

In this next study, we examined the debate preceding the congressional
approval of the use of military force against Iraq. Regime change had
been a long-standing position of the U.S. toward Iraq following the Gulf
War; however serious military action was not considered until after the
World Trade Center attacks on September 11, 2001. In 2002, President
Bush declared Iraq part of an \enquote{axis of evil} in his State of the
Union address. Iraq's repeated violations of nuclear arms agreements,
ties to terrorist organizations, and pursuit of weapons of mass
destruction were argued by the Bush Administration to potentially pose a
major threat to U.S. national security. This prompted the debate within
Congress as to whether or not to approve President Bush's request for
military action (Katzman, 2002). These studies were used to determine if
the findings from the first study extend to a different conflict.
Specifically, in the first part of this study, we examined the debate in
the House of Representatives to determine if members of Congress who
supported taking military action used more self and future references.

\hypertarget{method-3}{%
\section{Method}\label{method-3}}

Once again using the Government Publishing Office, we collected speeches
given in the House of Representatives pertaining to the use of U.S.
military force against Iraq in the three months before the vote on House
Joint Resolution 114 on October 10, 2002. This bill passed the House
with a 296-133 majority; with most Republicans supporting the measure
and 60\% of Democrats opposing. A total of 274 speeches were collected
representing 233 unique speakers. Of these speeches, 155 speeches were
made by Democrats, 119 were made by Republicans. The average word count
of the speeches was 742.34 (\emph{SD} = 1053.45). Four speeches were
excluded for no voting record.

As in the first study, bootstrapped means and confidence intervals as
well as effect sizes (Cohen's \(d_s\)) were calculated for speeches of
those supporting the measure versus those opposing the measure for the
following LIWC categories: first-person singular (\emph{I}),
first-person plural (\emph{we}), third-person singular (\emph{he},
\emph{she}), third-person plural (\emph{they}), past-tense,
present-tense, and future tense. Results can be seen as a forest plot in
Figure \ref{fig:Ipic} and in Table \ref{tab:Itable}. A non-zero effect
size difference emerged in the use of third-person singular pronouns.
Representatives who supported the military measure used other references
at a higher rate than those who opposed taking military action.

\section{Study 2B - Iraq in the
Senate}\label{study-2b---iraq-in-the-senate}}

In the second part of this study, we examined the debate in the Senate.
We wished to determine if, like senators who opposed military action in
Kosovo, senators who opposed action against Iraq used more group
references as well as more reference to current events or if senators
were more like House members debating Iraq.

\hypertarget{method-4}{%
\section{Method}\label{method-4}}

In this part of the study, speeches from the Senate were gathered for
the 6 months before the Senate vote on House Joint Resolution 114
conducted on October 11, 2002. The bill passed with a 77-23 majority.
All but one Republican supported the measure as did 58\% of Democrats.
In total, 138 speeches were collected representing 85 unique speakers.
Of these speeches, 74 were given by Democrats and 64 by Republicans. The
average word count for these speeches were 1991.23 (\emph{SD} =
1671.70).

\hypertarget{results-3}{%
\section{Results}\label{results-3}}

Analyses were conducted in the same manner as the first part of the
study to determine differences between supporters and opponents of
military action in Iraq in terms of the use of first-person singular
(\emph{I}), first-person plural (\emph{we}), third-person singular
(\emph{he}, \emph{she}), third-person plural (\emph{they}), past-tense,
present-tense, and future tense. Figure \ref{fig:Ipic} displays these
results as a forest plot, and all values are in Table \ref{tab:Itable}.
A large difference was found in the use of third-person singular
pronouns as well as a smaller difference in the use of past tense verbs.
Senators who supported the military measure tended to use more other
references (\emph{he}, \emph{his}) as well so as to be slightly more
oriented to past events.

\hypertarget{discussion-1}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion-1}}

The results from this second study more closely matched our hypotheses.
For both the House and Senate, members of Congress who supported taking
military action used more singular third person pronouns (\emph{he},
\emph{his}) than those who opposed taking military action. Contrary to
our hypothesis, no differences were found for plural third person
pronouns (\emph{they}, \emph{their}) meaning those who supported taking
action made more references to others as specific individuals and not as
groups. Although this finding was not quite the result we expected,
these differences make sense in light of the situation. In the case of
the Iraq War, the threat was seen not as a group of people but rather a
single individual, Saddam Hussein. Hence, for supporters of military
action, their focus was still external as was expected (Abe, 2012;
Matsumoto et al., 2015); however, their focus was on an individual
rather than a group.

The second hypothesis was partially supported. In the Senate, those who
supported taking military action used more references to the past than
those opposed to military action. However, this difference was not found
in the House, though the results were in the expected direction. As was
stated previously, this difference in results could be due to voting
procedures or compositional differences in the House and Senate. As a
final test of our hypotheses, we examined the Congressional debate
surrounding U.S. involvement in Libya during its 2011 civil war. We
might expect to find similar results to Study 1 as, like the Kosovo war,
there was less support for U.S. military involvement as well as a lack
of a perceived clear, immediate threat to the U.S.

\hypertarget{study-3---libya-in-the-house}{%
\section{Study 3 - Libya in the
House}\label{study-3---libya-in-the-house}}

In this final study, we examine the debate in the House of
Representatives surrounding U.S. military involvement in Libya during
its revolution. In February 2011, a revolt against Libyan dictator,
Muammar Qaddafi, prompted the intervention of NATO when Qaddafi
violently suppressed all opposition. The involvement of NATO lead to
debate within Congress as to the exact role of the U.S. in military
operations in Libya and the extent of U.S involvement (Blanchard, 2011).
In examining this debate, we wished to determine if the language of
those who supported or opposed military action was similar to those of
either of the first two studies.

\hypertarget{method-5}{%
\section{Method}\label{method-5}}

In this final study, the Congressional Record was searched for speeches
given in the House of Representatives pertaining to the debate of the
authorization of military action against Libya in the three months
before the vote on House Joint Resolution 68 on June 24, 2011. The bill
failed in the House 123-295. All but 14 Republicans voted against the
resolution while 60\% of Democrats supported the resolution. A total of
104 speeches were collected representing 76 unique speakers. Democrats
made 53 of these speeches while 51 speeches were made by Republicans.
The average word count for these speeches was 465.93 (\emph{SD} =
477.41). As the resolution failed in the House, it was not possible to
examine this debate in the Senate. Five speeches were excluded for no
voting record.

As in the first two studies, analyses consisted on comparing the
bootstrapped means, CIs, and effects sizes for those who supported the
military measure versus those who opposed it on the following linguistic
measures: first-person singular (\emph{I}), first-person plural
(\emph{we}), third-person singular (\emph{he}, \emph{she}), third-person
plural (\emph{they}), past-tense, present-tense, and future tense. These
results are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:Lpic} as a forest plot and in
Table \ref{tab:Ltable}. No differences emerged on any measure.

\hypertarget{discussion-2}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion-2}}

As might be expected given Study 1, no attentional differences between
those who supported and opposed taking military action in Libya in the
House of Representatives were found. This finding could indicate that in
situations where there is less Congressional support for military action
and no clear, immediate threat to the U.S., the difference between
support and opposition for military action is not a matter of attention
but other social and political forces.

\hypertarget{general-discussion}{%
\section{General Discussion}\label{general-discussion}}

The most probable reason for these findings is the change in the
dynamics of war. Historically, the U.S. would declare war on another
nation (i.e., fighting the Germans in WWI). In WWII, a slight shift
occurred where the U.S. was fighting not only another nation but also an
ideology (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy). With the beginning of the Cold
War, another movement happened where the U.S. did not directly fight
another nation (USSR) but instead fought indirectly with proxy wars
(Korean War, Vietnam War) while battling against enemy ideology
(Communism). After the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union, the
focus shifted to the United States' main conflict being the war on
terror in which there is no nation to battle against just an idea
(Matthews, 2014). Furthermore, Balas, Owsiak, and Diehl (2012) argued
that one possible motivation for war, since the end of the Cold War, was
the increased emphasis on the international norms of democratization and
humanitarianism. Hence, the use of singular third person pronouns could
reflect a focus on dictators violating human rights as a cause for
conflict (i.e., Hussein in Iraq, Milosevic in Kosovo, and Qaddafi in
Libya). Furthermore, the use of masculine pronouns would seem to lend
some support for this explanation.

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

The sample and methods used in the study, while useful, can also be
somewhat limited in scope. First, even though the Congressional Record
represents everything said on the floor of Congress, it does not
necessarily represent the entirety of Congress. Our sample incorporates
nearly 15 years in Congress. This time period encompassed seven election
cycles and at any given time, there are 100 senators and 435 congressmen
and women. While our data set likely included speeches from the more
influential senators and congressmen and women, we cannot predict voting
from those who did not speak. Furthermore, our findings regarding
masculine versus feminine pronouns could be confounded by the
under-representation of women in Congress. In the 113th Congress, women
comprised 20\% of the Senate and 18\% of the House (Manning \& Brudnick,
2014). For the years of voting records we used, there were 96 women in
Congress in 2011, 73 in 2002, and 67 in 1999 compared to 105 women in
the current Congress. Another limitation is tied to using word frequency
as an independent measure, although Tausczik and Pennebaker (2010) have
provided support for this research. Word frequency is a meaningful
measure of language, though it does fail to take into account context,
sarcasm, and other subtle aspects of language.

\hypertarget{future-directions}{%
\subsection{Future Directions}\label{future-directions}}

While we were unable to find strong evidence for our hypotheses in these
studies, the method used has great potential for enhancing the
understanding of legislative decision making. We examined only one small
area of policy using a single psychological process, but future research
could explore foreign policy more widely or education policy or any
number of legislative areas where there is recurrent debate.
Furthermore, our investigation was limited to studying attentional
focus, but with LIWC2015 or other language analysis methods, future
research could examine thinking style, emotionality, authenticity,
cognitive processing, or any number of other psychological constructs.
When it comes to politics there is no lack of political rhetoric, making
language analysis a powerful tool for political psychology, especially
when combined with other behavioral data such as voting records.
